# Setup

This repository accompanies the [Build a Neo4j-backed Chatbot using Python course](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-chatbot-python/) on [GraphAcademy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com).

When the devcontainer is created, such as in a GitHub codespace, all the required software and packages will be installed.

Follow the [Setup Instructions in GraphAcademy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-chatbot-python/1-project-setup/2-setup/) to get started.

To start the chatbot, run:

```bash
streamlit run bot.py
```
